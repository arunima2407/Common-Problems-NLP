# Common-Problems-NLP
This one addresses a generic solution to most NLP tasks.

So, I'm working on a solution for 'insecure questions quora' challenge from kaggle. You can check out right here.
https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification

I'm using GloVe for vectorization. Here's the official documentation.
https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/

The dataset is quite huge, so please download it from 
https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification/data


And I've commented description on each code segment for better understanding.

This code can be used for any problem, you just need to change the dataset. You can also try with the different word2vec algorithms like:
  
  GoogleNews-vectors-negative300 - https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/
  paragram_300_sl999 - https://cogcomp.org/page/resource_view/106
  wiki-news-300d-1M - https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/english-vectors.html


P.S. I am new to NLP. Correct me wherever I'm wrong.
